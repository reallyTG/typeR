# typeR
Large-scale analysis of type usage in R. The end-goal of this project is to build a type system for R that programmers will benefit from and be interested in using. If you have any ideas, I'm all ears!

### Update Jan 2020:

Repo's been quiet for a while.

We've written a new analysis to get better data, and have some new data available. The old data is still stored locally if that's something you're interested in, but you'll have to ping me for that.

Some notebooks showing some of our data analysis functions and techniques are forthcoming.
