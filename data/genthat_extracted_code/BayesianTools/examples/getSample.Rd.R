### Name: getSample
### Title: Extracts the sample from a bayesianOutput
### Aliases: getSample

### ** Examples

ll = function(x) sum(dnorm(x, log = TRUE))

setup = createBayesianSetup(ll, lower = c(-10,-10), upper = c(10,10))

settings = list(nrChains = 2, iterations = 1000)
out <- runMCMC(bayesianSetup = setup, sampler = "DEzs", settings = settings)

# population MCMCs divide the interations by the number of internal chains,
# so the end of the 3 chains is 1000/3 = 334
sample <- getSample(out, start = 100, end = 334, thin = 10) 

# sampling with number of samples instead of thinning and
# returning a coda object
sample <- getSample(out, start = 100, numSamples = 60, coda = TRUE)
plot(sample)


# MCMC with a single chain:
settings_2 <- list(nrChains = 1, iterations = 1000)
out_2 <- runMCMC(setup, sampler = "Metropolis", settings = settings_2)
sample_2 <- getSample(out_2, numSamples = 100)
