### Name: marginalLikelihood
### Title: Calcluated the marginal likelihood from a set of MCMC samples
### Aliases: marginalLikelihood

### ** Examples

# Low dimensional case with narrow priors - all methods have low error

# we use a truncated normal for the likelihood to make sure that the density 
# integrates to 1 - makes it easier to calcuate the theoretical ML
likelihood <- function(x) sum(msm::dtnorm(x, log = TRUE, lower = -1, upper = 1))
prior = createUniformPrior(lower = rep(-1,2), upper = rep(1,2))
bayesianSetup <- createBayesianSetup(likelihood = likelihood, prior = prior)
out = runMCMC(bayesianSetup = bayesianSetup, settings = list(iterations = 5000))

# plot(out)

# theoretical value
theory = log(1/(2^2))

marginalLikelihood(out)$ln.ML - theory
marginalLikelihood(out, method = "Prior", numSamples =  500)$ln.ML - theory
marginalLikelihood(out, method = "HM", numSamples =  500)$ln.ML - theory
marginalLikelihood(out, method = "Bridge", numSamples =  500)$ln.ML - theory


# higher dimensions - wide prior - HM and bridge don't work.

likelihood <- function(x) sum(msm::dtnorm(x, log = TRUE, lower = -10, upper = 10))
prior = createUniformPrior(lower = rep(-10,3), upper = rep(10,3))
bayesianSetup <- createBayesianSetup(likelihood = likelihood, prior = prior)
out = runMCMC(bayesianSetup = bayesianSetup, settings = list(iterations = 5000))

# plot(out)

# theoretical value
theory = log(1/(20^3))

marginalLikelihood(out)$ln.ML - theory
marginalLikelihood(out, method = "Prior", numSamples =  500)$ln.ML - theory
marginalLikelihood(out, method = "HM", numSamples =  500)$ln.ML - theory
