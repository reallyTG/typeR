library(BayesianTools)


### Name: runMCMC
### Title: Main wrapper function to start MCMCs, particle MCMCs and SMCs
### Aliases: runMCMC

### ** Examples

## Generate a test likelihood function. 
ll <- generateTestDensityMultiNormal(sigma = "no correlation")

## Create a BayesianSetup object from the likelihood 
## is the recommended way of using the runMCMC() function.
bayesianSetup <- createBayesianSetup(likelihood = ll, lower = rep(-10, 3), upper = rep(10, 3))

## Finally we can run the sampler and have a look
settings = list(iterations = 1000, adapt = FALSE)
out <- runMCMC(bayesianSetup = bayesianSetup, sampler = "Metropolis", settings = settings)

## out is of class bayesianOutput. There are various standard functions 
# implemented for this output

plot(out)
correlationPlot(out)
marginalPlot(out)
summary(out)

## additionally, you can return the sample as a coda object, and make use of the coda functions
# for plotting and analysis

codaObject = getSample(out, start = 500, coda = TRUE)
