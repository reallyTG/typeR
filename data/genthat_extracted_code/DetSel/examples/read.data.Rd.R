### ** Examples

## This is to generate an example file in the working directory.
make.example.files()

## This will read an input file named 'data.dat' that contains co-dominant markers,
## and a maximum allele frequency of 0.99 will be applied (i.e., by removing 
## marker loci in the observed and simulated datasets that have an allele with
## frequency larger than 0.99).
read.data(infile = 'data.dat',dominance = FALSE,maf = 0.99)
