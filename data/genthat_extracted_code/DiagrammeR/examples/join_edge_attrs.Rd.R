### Name: join_edge_attrs
### Title: Join new edge attribute values using a data frame
### Aliases: join_edge_attrs

### ** Examples

# Set a seed
set.seed(23)

# Create a simple graph
graph <-
  create_graph() %>%
  add_n_nodes(n = 5) %>%
  add_edges_w_string(
    edges = "1->2 1->3 2->4 2->5 3->5")

# Create a data frame with node ID values
# representing the graph edges (with `from` and `to`
# columns), and, a set of numeric values
df <-
  data.frame(
    from = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3),
    to = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 5),
    values = rnorm(5, 5))

# Join the values in the data frame to the
# graph's edges; this works as a left join using
# identically-named columns in the graph and the df
# (in this case `from` and `to` are common to both)
graph <-
  graph %>%
  join_edge_attrs(
    df = df)

# Get the graph's internal edf to show that the
# join has been made
graph %>%
  get_edge_df()
