### ** Examples

## Not run: 
##D #The following example uses FourSamples.rda, which is a data set included in the package.
##D 
##D data(file = "FourSamples.rda")
##D out<-Dpit(FourSamples)
##D 
##D #Full results are shown in Table 4 in Joo, Aguinis, and Bradley (2017)
##D 
##D #Next, to draw conclusions regarding the fit of a certain type of distribution per sample, 
##D #we suggest that users implement three decision rules, which are described in 
##D #the Analysis section in Joo, Aguinis, and Bradley (2017).
##D 
##D #Conclusions regarding the fit of distributions to the four samples in the focal data set
##D #--after applying the three decision rules--can be found in 
##D #the first two and last two rows in Table 3, in Joo, Aguinis, and Bradley (2017).
