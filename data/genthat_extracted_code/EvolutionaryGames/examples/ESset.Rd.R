### Name: ESset
### Title: Evolutionarily stable set for two-player games with three
###   strategies
### Aliases: ESset

### ** Examples

# Please note that the computation of evolutionarily stable sets 
# is rather time-consuming. 
# Depending on your machine you might need to wait more 
# than 10 seconds in order to run the following example.
## Not run: 
##D A <- matrix(c(-2, 5, 10/9, 0, 5/2, 10/9, -10/9, 35/9, 10/9), 3, byrow=TRUE)
##D strategies <- c("Hawk", "Dove", "Mixed ESS")
##D ESset(A, strategies)
## End(Not run)
