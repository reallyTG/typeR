### Name: var.expDeath
### Title: Variance estimation of the expected number of deaths
### Aliases: var.expDeath

### ** Examples

#This example uses pre-built objects and shows the simple usage
#of the est.expDeath function when those objects already exists.
#For an example of how to built those object, refer to the 
#help page of the screening dataset.

#Remove "#" to run example. The function can be quite long (a few hours) to run:
#data(req.objects);
#cox.data = req.objects$cox.data;
#var.expDeath(req.objects$contribution,req.objects$incid,req.objects$cox,fuzz = 0.01, 
#req.objects$covnames);
