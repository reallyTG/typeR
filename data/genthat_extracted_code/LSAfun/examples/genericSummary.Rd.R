### ** Examples
D <- "This is just a test document. It is set up just to throw some random 
sentences in this example. So do not expect it to make much sense. Probably, even 
the summary won't be very meaningful. But this is mainly due to the document not being
meaningful at all. For test purposes, I will also include a sentence in this 
example that is not at all related to the rest of the document. Lions are larger than cats."
