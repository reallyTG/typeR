### ** Examples

data(SeriesPost)

# How many times has each team won the World Series?

# Notes: 
# - the SeriesPost table includes an identifier for the 
# team (teamID), but not the franchise (e.g. the Brooklyn Dodgers
# [BRO] and Los Angeles Dodgers [LAN] are counted separately)
#
# - the World Series was first played in 1903, but the 
# Lahman data tables have the final round of the earlier 
# playoffs labelled "WS", so it is necessary to
# filter the SeriesPost table to exclude years prior to 1903. 

# using the dplyr data manipulation package
