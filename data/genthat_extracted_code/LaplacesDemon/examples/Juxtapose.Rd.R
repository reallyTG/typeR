### Name: Juxtapose
### Title: Juxtapose MCMC Algorithm Inefficiency
### Aliases: Juxtapose
### Keywords: Diagnostic Utilities

### ** Examples

### Update three demonoid objects, each from different MCMC algorithms.
### Suppose Fit1 was updated with AFSS, Fit2 with AMWG, and
### Fit3 with NUTS. Then, compare the inefficiencies:
#Juxt <- Juxtapose(list(Fit1=Fit1, Fit2=Fit2, Fit3=Fit3)); Juxt
#plot(Juxt, Style="ISM")
