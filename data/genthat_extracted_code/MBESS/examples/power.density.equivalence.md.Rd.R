### Keywords: design

### ** Examples

## Not run: 
##D # This function is called by power.equivalence.md within 
##D # the integrate function. It is integrated over 
##D # appropriate limits to compute the power. Use
##D 
##D power.density.equivalence.md(.1, alpha=.05, theta1=-.2, theta2=.2, diff=.05, 
##D 	sigma= .20, n=24, nu=22)
##D 
##D # The usage for the logarithmic scale is the same, except that 
##D # theta1, theta2, and diff must be on that scale. That is, use log(.8), etc.
## End(Not run)
