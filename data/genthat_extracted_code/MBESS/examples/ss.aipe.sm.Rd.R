### Name: ss.aipe.sm
### Title: Sample size planning for Accuracy in Parameter Estimation (AIPE)
###   of the standardized mean
### Aliases: ss.aipe.sm
### Keywords: design

### ** Examples

# Suppose the population mean is believed to be 20, and the population
# standard deviation is believed to be 2; thus the population standardized
# mean is believed to be 10. To determine the necessary sample size for a 
# study so that the full width of the 95 percent confidence interval 
# obtained in the study will be, with 90% assurance, no wider than 2.5, 
# the function should be specified as follows. 

# ss.aipe.sm(sm=10, width=2.5, conf.level=.95, assurance=.90)
