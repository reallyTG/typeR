### ** Examples


#The following example is derived from the "mix2_data" dataset, included
#in the MOTE library.

#Given previous research, we know that backward strength in free
#association tends to increase the ratings participants give when
#you ask them how many people out of 100 would say a word in
#response to a target word (like Family Feud). This result is
#tied to peopleâ€™s overestimation of how well they think they know
#something, which is bad for studying. So, we gave people instructions
#on how to ignore the BSG.  Did it help? Is there an interaction
#between BSG and instructions given?
