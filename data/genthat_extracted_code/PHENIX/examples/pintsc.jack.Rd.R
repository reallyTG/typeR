### ** Examples

# Dataset from Torices & MÃ©ndez (2014)
# This data set represents the dry mass (in grams) of inflorescence components of the sunflower
# species Tussilago farfara. The inflorescences were dissected in 'SCAPE', 'RECEPTACLE', 'MALEFL'
# (male flowers), 'OVAR' (reproductive part of female flowers), and 'RAYS' (the petaloid ray of
# female flower). Furthermore in the last column the total weight of the inflorescence is added
# 'TOTALSIZE'

# Iit is mandatory to define the "control" variable. Otherwise, it gives an error:
# pintsc.jack(tussilago, 1)
