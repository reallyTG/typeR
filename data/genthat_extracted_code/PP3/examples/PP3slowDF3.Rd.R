### ** Examples

#
# Not designed for simple user use
#
# Since these functions are simple wrappers for PP3ix3FromTU and
# PP3ix3dvsFromTU, please consult their help functions. All these
# functions do is take a single projection vector and then split it into
# three to provide three separate projection vectors for the called
# functions.
