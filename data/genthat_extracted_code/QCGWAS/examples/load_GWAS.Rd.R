library(QCGWAS)


### Name: load_GWAS
### Title: Easy loading of GWAS results files
### Aliases: load_GWAS load_test
### Keywords: files

### ** Examples

  ## As the function requires a GWAS file to work,
  ## the following code should be adjusted before execution.
  ## Because this is a demonstration, the nrows argument is used
  ## to read only the first 100 rows.
  
  # data_GWAS <-
  #    load_GWAS("GWA_results1.txt.zip",
  #              dir = "C:/GWAS_results",
  #              nrows = 100)
