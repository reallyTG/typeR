### Aliases: SimComp-package SimComp
### Keywords: package

### ** Examples

# Example 1:
# A comparison of the groups B and H against the standard S, for endpoint
# Thromb.count, assuming unequal variances for the groups. This is an
# extension of the well-known Dunnett-test to the case of heteroscedasticity.

data(coagulation)

comp1 <- SimTestDiff(data=coagulation, grp="Group", resp="Thromb.count",
  type="Dunnett", base=3, alternative="greater", covar.equal=FALSE)
comp1

# Example 2:
# A comparison of the groups B and H against the standard S, simultaneously
# for all endpoints, assuming unequal covariance matrices for the groups. This is
# an extension of the well-known Dunnett-test to the case of heteroscedasticity
# and multiple endpoints.
