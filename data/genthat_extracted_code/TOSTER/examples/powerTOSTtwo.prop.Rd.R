### Title: Power analysis for TOST for difference between two proportions
###   using Z-test (pooled)
### Aliases: powerTOSTtwo.prop

### ** Examples

## Sample size for alpha = 0.05, 90% power, assuming true effect prop1 = prop 2 = 0.5,
## equivalence bounds of 0.4 and 0.6 (so low_eqbound_prop = -0.1 and high_eqbound_prop = 0.1)

powerTOSTtwo.prop(alpha = 0.05, statistical_power = 0.9, prop1 = 0.5, prop2 = 0.5,
   low_eqbound_prop = -0.1, high_eqbound_prop = 0.1)

## Power for alpha = 0.05, N 542 , assuming true effect prop1 = prop 2 = 0.5,
## equivalence bounds of 0.4 and 0.6 (so low_eqbound_prop = -0.1 and high_eqbound_prop = 0.1)

powerTOSTtwo.prop(alpha = 0.05, N = 542, prop1 = 0.5, prop2 = 0.5,
   low_eqbound_prop = -0.1, high_eqbound_prop = 0.1)

## Equivalence bounds for alpha = 0.05, N 542 , assuming true effect prop1 = prop 2 = 0.5,
## and 90% power

powerTOSTtwo.prop(alpha=0.05, statistical_power=0.9, N=542, prop1 = 0.5, prop2 = 0.5)
