### Name: LTT.plot.gen
### Title: LTT.plot.gen: Calculates the number of lineages through time for
###   each input tree, as well as the average number of lineages over all
###   trees.
### Aliases: LTT.plot.gen

### ** Examples

# Simulation of a tree with a mrca at time 10 in the past, 
# under the density-dependent model
numbsim<-10
age<-10
lambda<-0.3
mu<-0.2
K<-40
# You can produce LTT plots as follows. 
# (for now this is un-commented, as some combinations of geiger / TreeSim on certain platforms 
# produce problems. If this is the case for you, please report to tanjs.stadler@bsse.ethz.ch).
