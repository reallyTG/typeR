### Name: bayessurvreg2
### Title: Cluster-specific accelerated failure time model for
###   multivariate, possibly doubly-interval-censored data. The error
###   distribution is expressed as a~penalized univariate normal mixture
###   with high number of components (G-spline). The distribution of the
###   vector of random effects is multivariate normal.
### Aliases: bayessurvreg2 C_bayessurvreg2
### Keywords: survival regression multivariate
