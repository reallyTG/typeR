### Keywords: classes methods

### ** Examples

# The example is quite silly, as you wouldn't likely do this in a
# single R session.  But if zdescription were passed to another R session
# via SNOW, foreach, or even by a simple file read/write,
# then the attach of the second R process would give access to the
# same object in memory.  Please see the package vignette for real examples.

z <- big.matrix(3, 3, type='integer', init=3)
z[,]
dim(z)
z[1,1] <- 2
z[,]
zdescription <- describe(z)
zdescription
y <- attach.big.matrix(zdescription)
y[,]
y
z
zz <- attach.resource(zdescription)
zz[1,1] <- -100
y[,]
z[,]
