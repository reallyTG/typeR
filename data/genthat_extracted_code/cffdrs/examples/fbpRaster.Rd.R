### ** Examples

# The dataset is the standard test data for FBP system
# provided by Wotton et al (2009), and randomly assigned
# to a stack of raster layers
test_fbpRastersrc <- system.file("extdata", "test_fbpRaster.tif", package="cffdrs")
test_fbpRaster <- stack(test_fbpRastersrc)
input<-test_fbpRaster
# Stack doesn't hold the raster layer names, we have to assign
# them:
names(input)<-c("FuelType","LAT","LONG","ELV","FFMC","BUI", "WS","WD","GS","Dj","D0","hr","PC",
"PDF","GFL","cc","theta","Accel","Aspect","BUIEff","CBH","CFL","ISI")
# Primary outputs:
system.time(foo<-fbpRaster(input = input))
# Using the "select" option:
system.time(foo<-fbpRaster(input = input,select=c("HFI","TFC", "ROS")))
# Secondary outputs:
system.time(foo<-fbpRaster(input = input,output="S"))
# All outputs:
#system.time(foo<-fbpRaster(input = input,output="A"))

### Additional, longer running examples are commented out below ###
# Keep only the required input layers, the other layers would be
# assigned with default values:
# keep only the required inputs:
# dat0<-input[[c("FuelType","LAT","LONG","FFMC","BUI","WS","GS", "Dj","Aspect")]]
# system.time(foo<-fbpRaster(input = dat0,output="A"))

# Using parallel computation option. This works better only when 
# the input is large. 
# First, create a large input by expanding the input stack:
# s<-input
# nrow(s)<-1000
# ncol(s)<-1000 
# s<-resample(input,s,method='ngb')
# Compare whether assign multiple cores would save running time:
# system.time(foo1<-fbpRaster(s))
# system.time(foo2<-fbpRaster(s,cores=4))
