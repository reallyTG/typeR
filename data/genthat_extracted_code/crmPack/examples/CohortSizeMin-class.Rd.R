mySize1 <- CohortSizeRange(intervals = c(0, 10),
                           cohortSize = c(1, 3))

# Rule for having cohort of size 1 until no DLT were observed
#      and having cohort of size 3 as soon as 1 DLT is observed
mySize2 <- CohortSizeDLT(DLTintervals=c(0, 1),
                         cohortSize=c(1, 3))

# Create a list of cohort size rules of class 'CohortSizeMax' which will then be 
# combined with the 'min' operation
mySize <- CohortSizeMin(cohortSizeList=list(mySize1, 
                                            mySize2))
