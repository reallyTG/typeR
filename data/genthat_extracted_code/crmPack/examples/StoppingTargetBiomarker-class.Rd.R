### ** Examples

# As example, here is the rule for: 
#   stopping the study if there is at least 0.5 probability that the biomarker 
#   (efficacy) is within the biomarker target range of [0.9, 1.0] (relative to the
#   maximum for the biomarker).

myStopping <- StoppingTargetBiomarker(target = c(0.9, 1),
                                      prob = 0.5)
