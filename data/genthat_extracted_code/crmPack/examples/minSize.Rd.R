### Title: "MIN" combination of cohort size rules
### Aliases: minSize minSize,CohortSize-method
### Keywords: methods

### ** Examples


# Here is the rule for: 
#   having cohort of size 1 for doses <30
#   and having cohort of size 3 for doses >=30
mySize1 <- CohortSizeRange(intervals = c(0, 30),
                           cohortSize = c(1, 3))

# Here is the rule for: 
#   having cohort of size 1 until no DLT were observed
#   and having cohort of size 3 as soon as 1 DLT is observed
mySize2 <- CohortSizeDLT(DLTintervals=c(0, 1),
                         cohortSize=c(1, 3))

# This is combining the two rules above by taking the minimum of the sample sizes of
# the single rules
mySize <- minSize(mySize1, mySize2)
