### Name: getOps
### Title: Returns the operator part of a linear (in)equality 'editmatrix'
###   E
### Aliases: getOps

### ** Examples


E <- editmatrix(c( "x+3*y == 2*z"
                 , "x > 2")
                 )
print(E)
                 
# get editrules, useful for storing and maintaining the rules external from your script
as.data.frame(E)
                 
# get coeficient matrix of inequalities
getA(E)

# get augmented matrix of linear edit set
getAb(E)

# get constants of inequalities (i.e. c(0, 2))                
getb(E)

# get operators of inequalities (i.e. c("==",">"))
getOps(E)

# get variables of inequalities (i.e. c("x","y","z"))
getVars(E)

# isNormalized
isNormalized(E)

#normalized E
E <- normalize(E)

# is het now normalized?
