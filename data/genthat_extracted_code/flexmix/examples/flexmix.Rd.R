### ** Examples


data("NPreg", package = "flexmix")

## mixture of two linear regression models. Note that control parameters
## can be specified as named list and abbreviated if unique.
ex1 <- flexmix(yn ~ x + I(x^2), data = NPreg, k = 2,
               control = list(verb = 5, iter = 100))

ex1
summary(ex1)
plot(ex1)

## now we fit a model with one Gaussian response and one Poisson
## response. Note that the formulas inside the call to FLXMRglm are
## relative to the overall model formula.
ex2 <- flexmix(yn ~ x, data = NPreg, k = 2,
               model = list(FLXMRglm(yn ~ . + I(x^2)), 
                            FLXMRglm(yp ~ ., family = "poisson")))
plot(ex2)

ex2
table(ex2@cluster, NPreg$class)

## for Gaussian responses we get coefficients and standard deviation
parameters(ex2, component = 1, model = 1)

## for Poisson response we get only coefficients
parameters(ex2, component = 1, model = 2)

## fitting a model only to the Poisson response is of course
## done like this
ex3 <- flexmix(yp ~ x, data = NPreg, k = 2,
               model = FLXMRglm(family = "poisson"))

## if observations are grouped, i.e., we have several observations per
## individual, fitting is usually much faster:
ex4 <- flexmix(yp~x|id1, data = NPreg, k = 2,
               model = FLXMRglm(family = "poisson"))

## And now a binomial example. Mixtures of binomials are not generically
## identified, here the grouping variable is necessary:
set.seed(1234)
ex5 <- initFlexmix(cbind(yb,1 - yb) ~ x, data = NPreg, k = 2,
                   model = FLXMRglm(family = "binomial"), nrep = 5)
table(NPreg$class, clusters(ex5))

ex6 <- initFlexmix(cbind(yb, 1 - yb) ~ x | id2, data = NPreg, k = 2,
                   model = FLXMRglm(family = "binomial"), nrep = 5)
table(NPreg$class, clusters(ex6))
