library(future)


### Name: sequential
### Title: Create a sequential future whose value will be in the current R
###   session
### Aliases: sequential uniprocess transparent

### ** Examples

## Use sequential futures
plan(sequential)

## A global variable
a <- 0

## Create a sequential future
f <- future({
  b <- 3
  c <- 2
  a * b * c
})

## Since 'a' is a global variable in future 'f' which
## is eagerly resolved (default), this global has already
## been resolved / incorporated, and any changes to 'a'
## at this point will _not_ affect the value of 'f'.
a <- 7
print(a)

v <- value(f)
print(v)
stopifnot(v == 0)
