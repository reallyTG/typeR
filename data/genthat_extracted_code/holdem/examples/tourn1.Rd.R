### Name: tourn1
### Title: Run a Texas Hold'em tournament
### Aliases: tourn1
### Keywords: ~kwd1 ~kwd2

### ** Examples

name1 = c("gravity","tommy","ursula","timemachine","vera","william","xena")
decision1 = list(gravity, tommy, ursula, timemachine, vera, william, xena) 
tourn1(name1, decision1, myfast1 = 2) ## run quickly
tourn1(name1, decision1, myfast1 = 0) ## run slowly, showing key hands

## The function is currently defined as
function(name1, decision1, chipstart1 = 1000, bigstart1 = 20, 
    inc1 = 1.50, winners1 = 3,myfast1 = 2, t1 = 0.5, t2=1, 
		  graphiccutoff1 = .1, lowercut1 = 30 ){
    ## Note: don't have more than 10 winners! That might mess this up.
    # blinds last 10 hands, then increase by factor of inc1. (rounded)
    # If # players left is 11-20, then each hand, players are split
    # into 2 tables of equal size (or one off if # players is odd). Then 10 hands are played,
    # no matter what.
    # Small = 1/2 big (rounded to nearest integer).
    # If num players > 20, then each 10 hands, players are randomly split
    # into tables of size 10. Remaining players sit out 10 hands.
    # a) Start loop. Initiate blinds.
    # b) Assign seats. Set num of tables.
    # c) For each table, play a hand. Repeat 10 times.
    # d) After each hand, update nplayers1, and 
    # if nplayers1 <= winners1, then store winners. See if all done too.
    # e) On key hands, do instant replay! (if all-in & call, and 
    #    total pool > 8 times big.
    # f) Increase blinds and repeat b-e.
