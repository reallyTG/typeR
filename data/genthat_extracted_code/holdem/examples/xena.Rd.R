### ** Examples

##---- Should be DIRECTLY executable !! ----
##-- ==>  Define data, use random,
##--	or do  help(data=index)  for the standard data sets.

## The function is currently defined as
function(numattable1, crds1, board1,  round1, currentbet, mychips1, pot1,
    roundbets, blinds1, chips1, ind1, dealer1, tablesleft){
    ## if pair of 10s or higher, all in for sure, no matter what.
    ## if AK or AQ, all in with probability 75%.
    ## if pair of 7s or higher and there are 6 or fewer players 
    ##      at your table (including you), then all in. 
    ## if your chip count is less than twice the big blind, go all in with any cards.
    ## if nobody's raised yet:
    ##     ... and if there are 3 or fewer players left behind you,
    ##              then go all in with any pair or any ace.
    ##     ... and there's only 1 or 2 players behind you,
    ##              then go all in with any cards.
