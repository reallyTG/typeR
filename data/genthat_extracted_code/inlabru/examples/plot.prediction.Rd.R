### Aliases: plot.prediction

### ** Examples

## No test: 
# Generate some data

input.df <- data.frame(x=cos(1:10))
input.df <- within(input.df, y <- 5 + 2*cos(1:10) + rnorm(10, mean=0, sd=0.1))

# Fit a model with fixed effect 'x' and intercept 'Intercept'

fit <- bru(y ~ x, "gaussian", input.df)

# Predict posterior statistics of 'x'

xpost = predict(fit, formula = ~ x)

# The statistics include mean, standard deviation, the 2.5% quantile, the median,
# the 97.5% quantile, minimum and maximum sample drawn from the posterior as well as
# the coefficient of variation and the variance.

xpost

# For a single variable like 'x' the default plotting method invoked by gg() will
# show these statisics in a fashion similar to a box plot:
ggplot() + gg(xpost)


# The predict function can also be used to simulatenneously estimate posteriors
# of multiple variables:

xipost = predict(fit, formula = ~ data.frame(post = c(Intercept, x)))
xipost

# If we still want a plot in the previous style we have to set the bar parameter to TRUE

rownames(xipost) = c("Intercept","x")
p1 = ggplot() + gg(xipost, bar = TRUE)
p1

# Note that gg also understands the posterior estimates generated while running INLA

p2 = ggplot() + gg(fit$summary.fixed, bar = TRUE)
multiplot(p1, p2)

# By default, if the prediction has more than one row, gg will plot the column 'mean' against
# the row index. This is for instance usefuul for predicting and plotting function
# but not very meaningful given the above example:

ggplot() + gg(xipost)

# For ease of use we can also type

plot(xipost)

# This type of plot will show a ribbon around the mean, which viszualizes the upper and lower
# quantiles mentioned above (2.5 and 97.5%). Plotting the ribbon can be turned of using the
# \code{ribbon} parameter

ggplot() + gg(xipost, ribbon = FALSE)

# Much like the other geomes produced by gg we can adjust the plot using ggplot2 style
# commands, for instance

ggplot() + 
  gg(xipost) +
  gg(xipost, mapping = aes(y = median), ribbon = FALSE, color = "red")
