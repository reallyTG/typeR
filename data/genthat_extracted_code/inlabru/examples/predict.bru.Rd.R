if (require("INLA", quietly = TRUE)) {

# Load the Gorilla data

data(gorillas, package ="inlabru")

# Plot the Gorilla nests, the mesh and the survey boundary

ggplot() +
  gg(gorillas$mesh) +
  gg(gorillas$nests) +
  gg(gorillas$boundary) +
  coord_fixed()

# Define SPDE prior

matern <- inla.spde2.pcmatern(gorillas$mesh,
                              prior.sigma = c(0.1, 0.01),
                              prior.range = c(5, 0.01))

# Define domain of the LGCP as well as the model components (spatial SPDE effect and Intercept)

cmp <- coordinates ~ mySmooth(map = coordinates, model = matern) + Intercept

# Fit the model
fit <- lgcp(cmp, gorillas$nests, samplers = gorillas$boundary)

# Once we obtain a fitted model the predict function can serve various purposes. 
# The most basic one is to determine posterior statistics of a univariate
# random variable in the model, e.g. the intercept

icpt <- predict(fit, NULL, ~ Intercept)
rownames(icpt) = "Intercept"
plot(icpt)

# The formula argument can take any expression that is valid within the model, for
# instance a non-linear transformation of a random variable

exp.icpt <- predict(fit, NULL, ~ exp(Intercept))
rownames(exp.icpt) = "exp(Intercept)"
plot(rbind(icpt, exp.icpt), bar = TRUE)

# The intercept is special in the sense that it does not depend on other variables
# or covariates. However, this is not true for the smooth spatial effects 'mySmooth'.
# In order to predict 'mySmooth' we have to define where (in space) to predict. For
# this purpose, the second argument of the predict function can take \code{data.frame}
# objects as well as Spatial objects. For instance, we might want to predict
# 'mySmooth' at the locations of the mesh vertices. Using

vrt = vertices(gorillas$mesh)

# we obtain these vertices as a SpatialPointsDataFrame

ggplot() + gg(gorillas$mesh) + gg(vrt, color = "red")

# Predicting 'mySmooth' at these locations works as follows

mySmooth = predict(fit, vrt, ~ mySmooth)

# Note that just like the input also the output will be a SpatialPointsDataFrame
# and that the predicted statistics are simply added as columns

class(mySmooth)
head(vrt)
head(mySmooth)

# Plotting the mean, for instance, at the mesh node is straight forward

ggplot() + 
  gg(gorillas$mesh) + 
  gg(mySmooth, aes(color = mean), size = 3)

# However, we are often interested in a spatial field and thus a linear interpolation,
# which can be achieved by using the gg mechanism for meshes

ggplot() + gg(gorillas$mesh, color = mySmooth$mean)

# Alternatively, we can predict the spatial field at a grid of locations, e.g. a
# SpatialPixels object covering the mesh

pxl = pixels(gorillas$mesh)
mySmooth = predict(fit, pxl, ~ mySmooth)

# This will give us a SpatialPixelDataFrame with the columns we are looking for

head(mySmooth)
ggplot() + gg(mySmooth)
