library(lazyeval)


### Name: lazy_dots
### Title: Capture ... (dots) for later lazy evaluation.
### Aliases: lazy_dots

### ** Examples

lazy_dots(x = 1)
lazy_dots(a, b, c * 4)

f <- function(x = a + b, ...) {
  lazy_dots(x = x, y = a + b, ...)
}
f(z = a + b)
f(z = a + b, .follow_symbols = TRUE)

# .follow_symbols is off by default because it causes problems
# with lazy loaded objects
lazy_dots(letters)
lazy_dots(letters, .follow_symbols = TRUE)

# You can also modify a dots like a list. Anything on the RHS will
# be coerced to a lazy.
l <- lazy_dots(x = 1)
l$y <- quote(f)
l[c("y", "x")]
l["z"] <- list(~g)

c(lazy_dots(x = 1), lazy_dots(f))
