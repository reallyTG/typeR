### Name: longest.chain
### Title: find out the food chain with longest length among all food
###   chains that are linked to a given species
### Aliases: longest.chain

### ** Examples

#mat=matrix(c(0,5,3,7,0,5,0,8,0,4,3,8,0,1,6,7,0,1,0,2,0,4,6,2,0),5,5)
#search for species 3
#lclw(gemat=mat,sp=3)
#longest chain isn't necessary to have largest weights
#largest.weight(gemat=mat,sp=3)
#longest.chain(gemat=mat,sp=3)
