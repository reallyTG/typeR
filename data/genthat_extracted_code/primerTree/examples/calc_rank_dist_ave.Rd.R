### Name: calc_rank_dist_ave
### Title: Summarize pairwise differences.
### Aliases: calc_rank_dist_ave

### ** Examples

## Not run: 
##D calc_rank_dist_ave(mammals_16S)
##D 
##D calc_rank_dist_ave(bryophytes_trnL)
##D 
##D # Note that the differences between the results from these two primers
##D # the mean nucleotide differences is much higher for the mammal primers
##D # than the byrophyte primers. This suggests that the mammal primers have
##D # better resolution to distinguish individual species.
