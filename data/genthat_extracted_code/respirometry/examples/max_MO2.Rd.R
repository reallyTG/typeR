max_MO2(flow_rate = 1)

# What is the maximum MO2 organism I can place in my respirometer and still maintain at
# least 75% air saturation when the intake fresh water is 1.5 LPM, 10 Â°C and 90% air saturated?
(max_mo2 <- max_MO2(flow_rate = 1.5, min_pO2 = 75, pO2_in = 90, temp = 10, sal = 0))

# If a 300 g individual has an MO2 of 2000 umol/hr, how big of an animal can I use?
scale_MO2(mass_1 = 300, MO2_1 = 2000, MO2_2 = max_mo2) # I can almost support a 1 kg individual!
