We compared varying samples sizes ranging from 5 tehsils (villages) in each province to full enumeration.  While the research is still ongoing we have so far demonstrated that as few as 10 tehsils per province is sufficient.  This should help improve future responses to disasters.\\n\n\\end{research}"

This should help improve future responses to disasters.\nI was engaged in statistical and analytic support to Dr. Garfield of Columbia’s School of Nursing and Dr. John Mutter from Columbia’s Earth Institute in their study of the socioeconomic, health and geographic factors affecting deaths in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. We are reconciling a self-reporting death list with an official State list that is thought to under represent Katrina related deaths. The goal is to determine what disparities, if any, resulted in a greater proportion of deaths among certain populations as opposed to others. The analysis will result in journal article preparation in in which I will be one of the authors.\n\\end{Research}"
