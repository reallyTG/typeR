#
# The pedigree file consists of one record for each individual in the data
# set.  Each record must include the following fields:
#
#    ego ID, father ID, mother ID, sex
#
# In addition, a family ID is required when ego IDs are not unique across
# the entire data set.  If the data set contains genetically identical
# individuals, an MZ-twin ID must be present (as described below).  If an
# analysis of household effects is planned, a household ID can be included
# (also described below).
#
# The default field names are ID, FA, MO, SEX, FAMID, MZTWIN, and HHID.
#
