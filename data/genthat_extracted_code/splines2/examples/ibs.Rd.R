library(splines2)


### Name: ibs
### Title: Integral of B-Spline Basis for Polynomial Splines
### Aliases: ibs

### ** Examples

library(splines2)
x <- seq.int(0, 1, 0.01)
knots <- c(0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 0.9)
ibsMat <- ibs(x, knots = knots, degree = 1, intercept = TRUE)

## the B-spline bases integrated by function bSpline (same arguments)
bsMat0 <- bSpline(x, knots = knots, degree = 1, intercept = TRUE)
## or by function deriv (recommended) that directly extracts the existing
## result from the attribute of ibsMat and thus is much more efficient.
bsMat <- deriv(ibsMat)
stopifnot(all.equal(bsMat0, bsMat, check.attributes = FALSE)) # equivalent

## plot B-spline basis with their corresponding integrals
library(graphics)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
matplot(x, bsMat, type = "l", ylab = "B-spline basis")
abline(v = knots, lty = 2, col = "gray")
matplot(x, ibsMat, type = "l", ylab = "Integral of B-spline basis")
abline(v = knots, lty = 2, col = "gray")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
