### Title: Span taxa
### Aliases: span

### ** Examples

# Hierarchy class
ex_hierarchy1

## ranks
### keep all taxa between family and genus
span(ex_hierarchy1, ranks("family", "genus"))
span(ex_hierarchy1, nms("Poaceae", "Poa"))
span(ex_hierarchy1, ids(4479, 4544))

### keep all taxa between genus and species
span(ex_hierarchy1, ranks("genus", "species"))

### keep all taxa greater than genus
span(ex_hierarchy1, ranks("> genus"))

### keep all taxa greater than or equal to genus
span(ex_hierarchy1, ranks(">= genus"))

### keep all taxa less than genus
span(ex_hierarchy1, ranks("< genus"))

### keep all taxa less than or equal to genus
span(ex_hierarchy1, ranks("<= genus"))

### same as above, with different dataset
span(ex_hierarchy2, ranks("> genus"))
span(ex_hierarchy2, ranks(">= genus"))
span(ex_hierarchy2, ranks("< genus"))
span(ex_hierarchy2, ranks("<= genus"))

# using taxonomic names
span(ex_hierarchy2, nms("< Felidae"))

# using taxonomic ids
span(ex_hierarchy2, ids("< 9681"))

## Multiple operator statements - useful with larger classifications
ex_hierarchy3
span(ex_hierarchy3, ranks("> genus"), ranks("< phylum"))
span(ex_hierarchy3, ids("> 161994"), ids("< 158852"))


## taxon names
### keep all taxa between Poaceae and Poa
### - matches to ranks first
ex_hierarchy1 %>% span(nms("Poaceae", "Poa"))

## taxon ids
### keep all taxa between 4479 and 4544 taxonomic IDs
### - matches to ranks first
ex_hierarchy1 %>% span(ids(4479, 4544))


# hierarchies class
invisible(lapply(ex_hierarchies, print))
ex_hierarchies %>% span(ranks("family", "genus")) %>% lapply(., print) %>%
