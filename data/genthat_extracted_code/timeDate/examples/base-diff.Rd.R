### ** Examples

## Create Character Vectors:
   dts = c("1989-09-28", "2001-01-15", "2004-08-30", "1990-02-09")
   dts
   tms = c(  "23:12:55",   "10:34:02",   "08:30:00",   "11:18:23")
   tms
   
## timeDate - 
   GMT = timeDate(dts, zone = "GMT", FinCenter = "GMT") + 24*3600
   GMT
   ZUR = timeDate(dts, zone = "GMT", FinCenter = "Europe/Zurich")
   ZUR

## diff - 
   # Suitably Lagged and Iterated Differences:
   diff(GMT)
   diff(GMT, lag = 2)
   diff(GMT, lag = 1, diff = 2)
