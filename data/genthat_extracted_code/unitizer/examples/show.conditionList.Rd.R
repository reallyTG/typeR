library(unitizer)


### Name: show.conditionList
### Title: Prints A list of Conditions
### Aliases: show.conditionList show,conditionList-method

### ** Examples

## Create a test item as you would find normally at the `unitizer` prompt
## for illustrative purposes:
.NEW <- mock_item()
## Show the conditions the test generated (typing `show` here is optional
## since auto-printing should dispatch to `show`)
show(.NEW$conditions)
