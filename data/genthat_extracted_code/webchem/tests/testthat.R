# All of the tests rely on the API existing and behaving as documented. However,
# the API occasionally falls over or stops working which lets to errors on CRAN.
# Because we use travis CI we will hear about any test failures as soon as they
# happen. So, let's skip all tests on CRAN:
#
# if (identical(Sys.getenv("NOT_CRAN"), "true")) {
#   test_check("webchem")
# }
