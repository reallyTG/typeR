### Name: cox.stuart.test
### Title: Cox-Stuart test for trend analysis The Cox-Stuart test is
###   defined as a little powerful test (power equal to 0.78), but very
###   robust for the trend analysis. It is therefore applicable to a wide
###   variety of situations, to get an idea of the evolution of values
###   obtained. The proposed method is based on the binomial distribution.
