## averaging over values in a month:
# x.date is jan 1,3,5,7; feb 9,11,13; mar 15,17,19
x.date <- as.Date(paste(2004, rep(1:4, 4:1), seq(1,20,2), sep = "-")); x.date
x <- zoo(rnorm(12), x.date); x
# coarser dates - jan 1 (4 times), feb 1 (3 times), mar 1 (3 times)
x.date2 <- as.Date(paste(2004, rep(1:4, 4:1), 1, sep = "-")); x.date2
x2 <- aggregate(x, x.date2, mean); x2
# same - uses as.yearmon
x2a <- aggregate(x, as.Date(as.yearmon(time(x))), mean); x2a
# same - uses by function
x2b <- aggregate(x, function(tt) as.Date(as.yearmon(tt)), mean); x2b
# same - uses cut
x2c <- aggregate(x, as.Date(cut(time(x), "month")), mean); x2c
# almost same but times of x2d have yearmon class rather than Date class
x2d <- aggregate(x, as.yearmon, mean); x2d
