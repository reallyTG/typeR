    abstract  = "A transaction defines a locus of computation that satisfies
                  important concurrency and failure properties. These
                  so-called ACID properties provide strong serialization
                  guarantees that allow us to reason about concurrent and
                  distributed programs in terms of higher-level units of
                  computation (e.g., transactions) rather than lower-level
                  data structures (e.g., mutual-exclusion locks). This paper
                  presents a framework for specifying the semantics of a
                  transactional facility integrated within a host
                  programming language. The TFJ calculus, an object calculus
                  derived from Featherweight Java, supports nested and
                  multi-threaded transactions. We give a semantics to TFJ
                  that is parametrized by the definition of the
                  transactional mechanism that permits the study of
                  different transaction models. We give two instantiations:
                  one that defines transactions in terms of a
                  versioning-based optimistic concurrency model, and the
                  other which specifies transactions in terms of a
                  pessimistic two-phase locking protocol, and present
                  soundness and serializability properties for our
                  semantics.",

   abstract = "The Seal Calculus is a process language for describing mobile
                  computation. Threads and resources are tree structured;
                  the nodes thereof correspond to agents, the units of
                  mobility. The Calculus extends a pi-calculus core with
                  synchronous, objective mobility of agents over
                  channels. This paper systematically compares all previous
                  variants of Seal Calculus. We study their operational
                  behaviour with labelled transition systems and
                  bisimulations; by comparing the resulting algebraic
                  theories we highlight the differences between these
                  apparently similar approaches. This leads us to identify
                  the dialect of Seal that is most amenable to operational
                  reasoning and can form the basis of a distributed
                  programming language. We propose type systems for
                  characterising the communications in which an agent can
                  engage. The type systems thus enforce a discipline of
                  agent mobility, since the latter is coded in terms of
                  higher-order communication.",

                  great flexibility for building parallel and distributed
                  applications composed of independent processes. However,
                  the shared space model does not provide protection against
                  untrustworthy processes. Linda processes communicate by
                  reading and writing messages in a globally visible data
                  space, so a malicious process can launch any number of
                  security attacks. This paper presents the design of a new
                  coordination model which extends Linda with fine-grained
                  access control. The semantics of the model is presented in
                  the context of a process calculus. A prototype of our
                  model, called SecOS, has been implemented in Java",
