  ABSTRACT     = {Bayesian Computation with R introduces Bayesian
                  modeling by the use of computation using the R
                  language.  The early chapters present the basic tenets
                  of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and
                  two-parameter inferential problems.  Bayesian
                  computational methods such as Laplace's method,
                  rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are
                  illustrated in the context of a random effects model.
                  The construction and implementation of Markov Chain
                  Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced.  These
                  simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a
                  variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and
                  binary response regression, hierarchical modeling,
                  order-restricted inference, and robust modeling.
                  Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian
                  tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the
                  posterior predictive distribution.  The use of R to
                  interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing
                  language, is described with several illustrative
                  examples.},

                  self-contained entry to computational Bayesian

                  and backed up by discussed real datasets available
                  from the book website, it provides an operational
                  methodology for conducting Bayesian inference, rather
                  than focusing on its theoretical justifications.
                  Special attention is paid to the derivation of prior
                  distributions in each case and specific reference
                  solutions are given for each of the models.
                  Similarly, computational details are worked out to
                  lead the reader towards an effective programming of
                  the methods given in the book.  While R programs are
                  provided on the book website and R hints are given in
                  the computational sections of the book, The Bayesian
                  Core requires no knowledge of the R language and it
                  can be read and used with any other programming

                  early exploratory phase, but in the later stages, too,
                  when comparing and evaluating models.  All examples

  ABSTRACT     = {This book is very different from any other publication
                  in the field and it is unique because of its focus on
                  the practical implementation of the simulation and
                  estimation methods presented.  The book should be
                  useful to practitioners and students with minimal
                  mathematical background, but because of the many R
                  programs, probably also to many mathematically well
                  educated practitioners.  Many of the methods presented
                  in the book have, so far, not been used much in
                  practice because the lack of an implementation in a
                  unified framework.  This book fills the gap.  With the
                  R code included in this book, a lot of useful methods
                  become easy to use for practitioners and students.  An
                  R package called `sde' provides functionswith easy
                  interfaces ready to be used on empirical data from
                  real life applications.  Although it contains a wide
                  range of results, the book has an introductory
                  character and necessarily does not cover the whole
                  spectrum of simulation and inference for general
                  stochastic differential equations.  The book is
                  organized in four chapters.  The first one introduces
                  the subject and presents several classes of processes
                  used in many fields of mathematics, computational
                  biology, finance and the social sciences.  The second
                  chapter is devoted to simulation schemes and covers
                  new methods not available in other milestones
                  publication known so far.  The third one is focused on
                  parametric estimation techniques.  In particular, it
                  includes exact likelihood inference, approximated and
                  pseudo-likelihood methods, estimating functions,
                  generalized method of moments and other techniques.
                  The last chapter contains miscellaneous topics like
                  nonparametric estimation, model identification and
                  change point estimation.  The reader non-expert in R

  ABSTRACT     = {R is rapidly growing in popularity as the environment
                  of choice for data analysis and graphics both in
                  academia and industry.  Lattice brings the proven
                  design of Trellis graphics (originally developed for S
                  by William S. Cleveland and colleagues at Bell Labs)
                  to R, considerably expanding its capabilities in the
                  process.  Lattice is a powerful and elegant high level
                  data visualization system that is sufficient for most
                  everyday graphics needs, yet flexible enough to be
                  easily extended to handle demands of cutting edge
                  research.  Written by the author of the lattice
                  system, this book describes it in considerable depth,
                  beginning with the essentials and systematically
                  delving into specific low levels details as necessary.
                  No prior experience with lattice is required to read
                  the book, although basic familiarity with R is
                  assumed.  The book contains close to 150 figures
                  produced with lattice.  Many of the examples emphasize
                  principles of good graphical design; almost all use
                  real data sets that are publicly available in various
                  R packages.  All code and figures in the book are also
                  available online, along with supplementary material

                  providing an accessible introduction to the subject,
                  filled with examples drawn from the social and
                  political sciences.  Readers are introduced to the
                  principles of nonparametric smoothing and to a wide
                  variety of smoothing methods.  The author also explains
                  how smoothing methods can be incorporated into
                  parametric linear and generalized linear models.  The
                  use of smoothers with these standard statistical
                  models allows the estimation of more flexible
                  functional forms whilst retaining the interpretability
                  of parametric models.  The full potential of these
                  techniques is highlighted via the use of detailed
                  empirical examples drawn from the social and political
                  sciences.  Each chapter features exercises to aid in
                  the understanding of the methods and applications.

  ABSTRACT     = {Quantifying shape and size variation is essential in
                  evolutionary biology and in many other disciplines.
                  Since the ``morphometric revolution of the 90s,'' an
                  increasing number of publications in applied and
                  theoretical morphometrics emerged in the new
                  discipline of statistical shape analysis.  The R
                  language and environment offers a single platform to
                  perform a multitude of analyses from the acquisition
                  of data to the production of static and interactive
                  graphs.  This offers an ideal environment to analyze
                  shape variation and shape change.  This open-source
                  language is accessible for novices and for experienced
                  users.  Adopting R gives the user and developer
                  several advantages for performing morphometrics:
                  evolvability, adaptability, interactivity, a single
                  and comprehensive platform, possibility of interfacing
                  with other languages and software, custom analyses,
                  and graphs.  The book explains how to use R for
                  morphometrics and provides a series of examples of
                  codes and displays covering approaches ranging from
                  traditional morphometrics to modern statistical shape
                  analysis such as the analysis of landmark data, Thin
                  Plate Splines, and Fourier analysis of outlines.  The
                  book fills two gaps: the gap between theoreticians and
                  students by providing worked examples from the
                  acquisition of data to analyses and hypothesis
                  testing, and the gap between user and developers by
                  providing and explaining codes for performing all the
                  steps necessary for morphometrics rather than
                  providing a manual for a given software or package.
                  Students and scientists interested in shape analysis
                  can use the book as a reference for performing applied
                  morphometrics, while prospective researchers will
                  learn how to implement algorithms or interfacing R for
                  new methods.  In addition, adopting the R philosophy
                  will enhance exchanges within and outside the
                  morphometrics community.  Julien Claude is
                  evolutionary biologist and palaeontologist at the
                  University of Montpellier 2 where he got his Ph.D. in

                  series can be considered as the main methodology
                  employed in applied econometrics.  This book not only
                  introduces the reader to this topic but enables him to
                  conduct the various unit root tests and co-integration
                  methods on his own by utilizing the free statistical
                  programming environment R.  The book encompasses
                  seasonal unit roots, fractional integration, coping
                  with structural breaks, and multivariate time series
                  models.  The book is enriched by numerous programming
                  examples to artificial and real data so that it is
                  ideally suited as an accompanying text book to
                  computer lab classes.  The second edition adds a
                  discussion of vector auto-regressive, structural
                  vector auto-regressive, and structural vector
                  error-correction models.  To analyze the interactions
                  between the investigated variables, further impulse
                  response function and forecast error variance
                  decompositions are introduced as well as forecasting.
                  The author explains how these model types relate to
                  each other.  Bernhard Pfaff studied economics at the

                  California; and Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.  He

                  economics department of the latter entity where he was
                  employed as a research and teaching assistant.  He has

  ABSTRACT     = {Since its inception, R has become one of the
                  preeminent programs for statistical computing and data
                  analysis.  The ready availability of the program,
                  along with a wide variety of packages and the
                  supportive R community make R an excellent choice for
                  almost any kind of computing task related to
                  statistics.  However, many users, especially those
                  with experience in other languages, do not take
                  advantage of the full power of R.  Because of the
                  nature of R, solutions that make sense in other
                  languages may not be very efficient in R.  This book
                  presents a wide array of methods applicable for
                  reading data into R, and efficiently manipulating that
                  data.  In addition to the built-in functions, a number
                  of readily available packages from CRAN (the
                  Comprehensive R Archive Network) are also covered.
                  All of the methods presented take advantage of the
                  core features of R: vectorization, efficient use of
                  subscripting, and the proper use of the varied
                  functions in R that are provided for common data
                  management tasks.  Most experienced R users discover
                  that, especially when working with large data sets, it
                  may be helpful to use other programs, notably
                  databases, in conjunction with R.  Accordingly, the
                  use of databases in R is covered in detail, along with
                  methods for extracting data from spreadsheets and
                  datasets created by other programs.  Character
                  manipulation, while sometimes overlooked within R, is
                  also covered in detail, allowing problems that are
                  traditionally solved by scripting languages to be
                  carried out entirely within R.  For users with
                  experience in other languages, guidelines for the
                  effective use of programming constructs like loops are
                  provided.  Since many statistical modeling and
                  graphics functions need their data presented in a data
                  frame, techniques for converting the output of
                  commonly used functions to data frames are provided
                  throughout the book.  Using a variety of examples
                  based on data sets included with R, along with easily
                  simulated data sets, the book is recommended to anyone
                  using R who wishes to advance from simple examples to
                  practical real-life data manipulation solutions.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Time Series Analysis With Applications in R, Second
                  Edition, presents an accessible approach to
                  understanding time series models and their
                  applications.  Although the emphasis is on time domain
                  ARIMA models and their analysis, the new edition
                  devotes two chapters to the frequency domain and three
                  to time series regression models, models for
                  heteroscedasticty, and threshold models.  All of the
                  ideas and methods are illustrated with both real and
                  simulated data sets.  A unique feature of this edition
                  is its integration with the R computing environment.
                  The tables and graphical displays are accompanied by
                  the R commands used to produce them.  An extensive R
                  package, TSA, which contains many new or revised R
                  functions and all of the data used in the book,
                  accompanies the written text.  Script files of R
                  commands for each chapter are available for download.
                  There is also an extensive appendix in the book that
                  leads the reader through the use of R commands and the
                  new R package to carry out the analyses.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Advances in statistical methodology and computing have
                  played an important role in allowing researchers to
                  more accurately assess the health effects of ambient
                  air pollution.  The methods and software developed in
                  this area are applicable to a wide array of problems
                  in environmental epidemiology.  This book provides an
                  overview of the methods used for investigating the
                  health effects of air pollution and gives examples and
                  case studies in R which demonstrate the application of
                  those methods to real data.  The book will be useful
                  to statisticians, epidemiologists, and graduate
                  students working in the area of air pollution and
                  health and others analyzing similar data.  The authors
                  describe the different existing approaches to
                  statistical modeling and cover basic aspects of
                  analyzing and understanding air pollution and health
                  data.  The case studies in each chapter demonstrate
                  how to use R to apply and interpret different
                  statistical models and to explore the effects of
                  potential confounding factors.  A working knowledge of
                  R and regression modeling is assumed.  In-depth
                  knowledge of R programming is not required to
                  understand and run the examples.  Researchers in this
                  area will find the book useful as a ``live''
                  reference.  Software for all of the analyses in the
                  book is downloadable from the web and is available
                  under a Free Software license.  The reader is free to
                  run the examples in the book and modify the code to
                  suit their needs.  In addition to providing the
                  software for developing the statistical models, the
                  authors provide the entire database from the National
                  Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS)
                  in a convenient R package.  With the database, readers

  ABSTRACT     = {Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R is divided into
                  two basic parts, the first presenting R packages,
                  functions, classes and methods for handling spatial
                  data.  This part is of interest to users who need to
                  access and visualise spatial data.  Data import and
                  export for many file formats for spatial data are
                  covered in detail, as is the interface between R and
                  the open source GRASS GIS. The second part showcases
                  more specialised kinds of spatial data analysis,
                  including spatial point pattern analysis,
                  interpolation and geostatistics, areal data analysis
                  and disease mapping.  The coverage of methods of
                  spatial data analysis ranges from standard techniques
                  to new developments, and the examples used are largely
                  taken from the spatial statistics literature.  All the
                  examples can be run using R contributed packages
                  available from the CRAN website, with code and
                  additional data sets from the book's own website.
                  This book will be of interest to researchers who
                  intend to use R to handle, visualise, and analyse
                  spatial data.  It will also be of interest to spatial
                  data analysts who do not use R, but who are interested
                  in practical aspects of implementing software for
                  spatial data analysis.  It is a suitable companion
                  book for introductory spatial statistics courses and
                  for applied methods courses in a wide range of
                  subjects using spatial data, including human and
                  physical geography, geographical information systems,
                  the environmental sciences, ecology, public health and
                  disease control, economics, public administration and
                  political science.  The book has a website where
                  coloured figures, complete code examples, data sets,

  ABSTRACT     = {Wavelet methods have recently undergone a rapid period
                  of development with important implications for a
                  number of disciplines including statistics.  This book
                  fulfils three purposes.  First, it is a gentle
                  introduction to wavelets and their uses in statistics.
                  Second, it acts as a quick and broad reference to many
                  recent developments in the area.  The book
                  concentrates on describing the essential elements and
                  provides comprehensive source material references.
                  Third, the book intersperses R code that explains and
                  demonstrates both wavelet and statistical methods.
                  The code permits the user to learn the methods, to
                  carry out their own analyses and further develop their
                  own methods.  The book is designed to be read in
                  conjunction with WaveThresh4, the freeware R package
                  for wavelets.  The book introduces the wavelet
                  transform by starting with the simple Haar wavelet
                  transform and then builds to consider more general
                  wavelets such as the Daubechies compactly supported
                  series.  The book then describes the evolution of
                  wavelets in the directions of complex-valued wavelets,
                  non-decimated transforms, multiple wavelets and
                  wavelet packets as well as giving consideration to
                  boundary conditions initialization.  Later chapters
                  explain the role of wavelets in nonparametric
                  regression problems via a variety of techniques
                  including thresholding, cross-validation, SURE,
                  false-discovery rate and recent Bayesian methods, and
                  also consider how to deal with correlated and
                  non-Gaussian noise structures.  The book also looks at
                  how nondecimated and packet transforms can improve
                  performance.  The penultimate chapter considers the
                  role of wavelets in both stationary and non-stationary
                  time series analysis.  The final chapter describes
                  recent work concerning the role of wavelets for
                  variance stabilization for non-Gaussian intensity
                  estimation.  The book is aimed at final year
                  undergraduate and Masters students in a numerate
                  discipline (such as mathematics, statistics, physics,
                  economics and engineering) and would also suit as a
                  quick reference for postgraduate or research level
                  activity.  The book would be ideal for a researcher to
                  learn about wavelets, to learn how to use wavelet
                  software and then to adapt the ideas for their own
                  purposes.},

  ABSTRACT     = {This is the first book on applied econometrics using
                  the R system for statistical computing and graphics.
                  It presents hands-on examples for a wide range of
                  econometric models, from classical linear regression
                  models for cross-section, time series or panel data
                  and the common non-linear models of microeconometrics
                  such as logit, probit and tobit models, to recent
                  semiparametric extensions.  In addition, it provides a
                  chapter on programming, including simulations,
                  optimization, and an introduction to R tools enabling
                  reproducible econometric research.  An R package
                  accompanying this book, AER, is available from the
                  Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at
                  \url{http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AER}.  It
                  contains some 100 data sets taken from a wide variety
                  of sources, the full source code for all examples used
                  in the text plus further worked examples, e.g., from
                  popular textbooks. The data sets are suitable for
                  illustrating, among other things, the fitting of wage
                  equations, growth regressions, hedonic regressions,
                  dynamic regressions and time series models as well as
                  models of labor force participation or the demand for
                  health care.  The goal of this book is to provide a
                  guide to R for users with a background in economics or
                  the social sciences. Readers are assumed to have a
                  background in basic statistics and econometrics at the
                  undergraduate level. A large number of examples should
                  make the book of interest to graduate students,
                  researchers and practitioners alike.  },

                  sciences are written at a level that a
                  non-statistician will easily understand.  This is a
                  book written in colloquial language, avoiding
                  mathematical formulae as much as possible, trying to
                  explain statistical methods using examples and
                  graphics instead. To use the book efficiently, readers
                  should have some computer experience. The book starts
                  with the simplest of statistical concepts and carries
                  readers forward to a deeper and more extensive
                  understanding of the use of statistics in
                  environmental sciences.  The book concerns the
                  application of statistical and other computer methods
                  to the management, analysis and display of spatial
                  data.  These data are characterised by including
                  locations (geographic coordinates), which leads to the
                  necessity of using maps to display the data and the
                  results of the statistical methods. Although the book
                  uses examples from applied geochemistry, and a large
                  geochemical survey in particular, the principles and
                  ideas equally well apply to other natural sciences,
                  e.g., environmental sciences, pedology, hydrology,
                  geography, forestry, ecology, and health
                  sciences/epidemiology.  The book is unique because it
                  supplies direct access to software solutions (based on
                  R, the Open Source version of the S-language for
                  statistics) for applied environmental statistics. For
                  all graphics and tables presented in the book, the
                  R-scripts are provided in the form of executable
                  R-scripts.  In addition, a graphical user interface
                  for R, called DAS+R, was developed for convenient,
                  fast and interactive data analysis.  Statistical Data

  ABSTRACT     = {A Modern Approach to Regression with R focuses on
                  tools and techniques for building regression models
                  using real-world data and assessing their
                  validity.  When weaknesses in the model are identified,
                  the next step is to address each of these
                  weaknesses.  A key theme throughout the book is that it
                  makes sense to base inferences or conclusions only on
                  valid models.  The regression output and plots that
                  appear throughout the book have been generated using
                  R.  On the book website you will find the R code used
                  in each example in the text.  You will also find
                  SAS code and STATA code to produce the equivalent
                  output on the book website.  Primers containing
                  expanded explanations of R, SAS and STATA and their
                  use in this book are also available on the book
                  website.  The book contains a number of new real data
                  sets from applications ranging from rating
                  restaurants, rating wines, predicting newspaper
                  circulation and magazine revenue, comparing the
                  performance of NFL kickers, and comparing finalists in
                  the Miss America pageant across states.  One of the
                  aspects of the book that sets it apart from many other
                  regression books is that complete details are provided
                  for each example.  The book is aimed at first year
                  graduate students in statistics and could also be used
                  for a senior undergraduate class.},

  ABSTRACT     = {R is a rapidly evolving lingua franca of graphical
                  display and statistical analysis of experiments from
                  the applied sciences.  Currently, R offers a wide
                  range of functionality for nonlinear regression
                  analysis, but the relevant functions, packages and
                  documentation are scattered across the R environment.
                  This book provides a coherent and unified treatment of
                  nonlinear regression with R by means of examples from
                  a diversity of applied sciences such as biology,
                  chemistry, engineering, medicine and toxicology.  The
                  book starts out giving a basic introduction to fitting
                  nonlinear regression models in R.  Subsequent chapters
                  explain the salient features of the main fitting
                  function nls(), the use of model diagnostics, how to
                  deal with various model departures, and carry out
                  hypothesis testing.  In the final chapter grouped-data
                  structures, including an example of a nonlinear
                  mixed-effects regression model, are considered.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Building on the successful Analysing Ecological Data
                  (2007) by Zuur, Ieno and Smith, the authors now
                  provide an expanded introduction to using regression
                  and its extensions in analysing ecological data.  As
                  with the earlier book, real data sets from
                  postgraduate ecological studies or research projects
                  are used throughout.  The first part of the book is a
                  largely non-mathematical introduction to linear mixed
                  effects modelling, GLM and GAM, zero inflated models,
                  GEE, GLMM and GAMM.  The second part provides ten case
                  studies that range from koalas to deep sea research.
                  These chapters provide an invaluable insight into
                  analysing complex ecological datasets, including
                  comparisons of different approaches to the same
                  problem.  By matching ecological questions and data
                  structure to a case study, these chapters provide an
                  excellent starting point to analysing your own data.

                  of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and

                  computational methods such as Laplace's method,
                  rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are
                  illustrated in the context of a random effects model.
                  The construction and implementation of Markov Chain
                  Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced.  These
                  simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a
                  variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and
                  binary response regression, hierarchical modeling,
                  order-restricted inference, and robust modeling.
                  Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian
                  tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the
                  posterior predictive distribution.  The use of R to
                  interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing

                  and the use of Zellner's g priors to choose between

                  to Multivariate Statistical Analysis in Chemometrics
                  presents simple yet thorough explanations of the most
                  important multivariate statistical methods for
                  analyzing chemical data.  It includes discussions of
                  various statistical methods, such as principal
                  component analysis, regression analysis,
                  classification methods, and clustering.  Written by a
                  chemometrician and a statistician, the book reflects
                  both the practical approach of chemometrics and the
                  more formally oriented one of statistics.  To enable a
                  better understanding of the statistical methods, the
                  authors apply them to real data examples from
                  chemistry.  They also examine results of the different
                  methods, comparing traditional approaches with their
                  robust counterparts.  In addition, the authors use the
                  freely available R package to implement methods,
                  encouraging readers to go through the examples and
                  adapt the procedures to their own problems.  Focusing
                  on the practicality of the methods and the validity of
                  the results, this book offers concise mathematical
                  descriptions of many multivariate methods and employs
                  graphical schemes to visualize key concepts.  It
                  effectively imparts a basic understanding of how to

  abstract     = {Statistics and hypothesis testing are routinely used
                  in areas (such as linguistics) that are
                  traditionally not mathematically intensive. In such
                  fields, when faced with experimental data, many
                  students and researchers tend to rely on commercial
                  packages to carry out statistical data analysis,
                  often without understanding the logic of the
                  statistical tests they rely on. As a consequence,
                  results are often misinterpreted, and users have
                  difficulty in flexibly applying techniques relevant
                  to their own research ��� they use whatever they
                  happen to have learned. A simple solution is to
                  teach the fundamental ideas of statistical
                  hypothesis testing without using too much
                  mathematics.  This book provides a non-mathematical,
                  simulation-based introduction to basic statistical
                  concepts and encourages readers to try out the
                  simulations themselves using the source code and
                  data provided (the freely available programming
                  language R is used throughout). Since the code
                  presented in the text almost always requires the use
                  of previously introduced programming constructs,
                  diligent students also acquire basic programming
                  abilities in R.  The book is intended for advanced
                  undergraduate and graduate students in any
                  discipline, although the focus is on linguistics,
                  psychology, and cognitive science. It is designed
                  for self-instruction, but it can also be used as a
                  textbook for a first course on statistics. Earlier
                  versions of the book have been used in undergraduate
                  and graduate courses in Europe and the US.},

                  learn and use fundamental methods for constructing
                  quantitative models of biological mechanisms, both
                  deterministic and with some elements of randomness,
                  including complex reaction equilibria and kinetics,
                  population models, and regulation of metabolism and
                  development; to understand how concepts of probability
                  can help in explaining important features of DNA
                  sequences; and to apply a useful set of statistical
                  methods to analysis of experimental data from
                  spectroscopic, genomic, and proteomic sources.  These
                  quantitative tools are implemented using the free,

                  statistical computing and graphics, with capabilities
                  similar to Matlab.  Since R is increasingly used in
                  bioinformatics applications such as the BioConductor
                  project, it can serve students as their basic
                  quantitative, statistical, and graphics tool as they
